# Atlas Collective

The Atlas Engineering Collective maintains a suite of developer tools inside a protected pocket of the multiverse — a place where prototype assets and "experimental artifacts" are stored while engineers iterate. Yesterday a junior engineer left the Atlas Dev Node running with a debug-only artifact route enabled. To make artifacts available to the rest of the stack, the team also deployed Echo, a thin gateway that fetches assets from Atlas on demand and is supposed to accept requests only from internal services.

Somewhere in the logs a maintenance account scribbled a placeholder: secrets/atlas_thread.txt. That file contains a dimensional signature you’ll need to claim victory.

Requires a few more additions, to make it more realistic.
